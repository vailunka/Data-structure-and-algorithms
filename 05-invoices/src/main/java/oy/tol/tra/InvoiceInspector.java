   /**
    * TODO: Implement this method so that the time complexity of creating new

    * handleInvoicesAndPaymentsSlow().
    * How to do this:
    * 1. Both invoices and payments need to be sorted, so implement sorting using one of the
    *    methods taught in the course. Quicksort and Heapsort are the most common ones to consider.
    *    You need only one generic implementation to sort both Invoice and Payment arrays!
         Note that both classes implement Comparable!
    * 2. After the invoices and payments have been sorted, you still need to handle all the invoices in a loop.
    * 3. When going through invoices, search for the corresponding payment using binary search.
    * 4. If a payment was found, deduct from the invoice what was paid. If must still pay something, create an invoice.
    * 5. If payment was not found, create a new invoice with the same invoice.
